# App Icons

This directory should contain the following PWA icons:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## How to Generate Icons

1. Create a 512x512 PNG image with your logo
2. Use an online tool like [PWA Asset Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) or [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
3. Upload your 512x512 image
4. Download all generated sizes
5. Place them in this directory

## Design Guidelines

- Use the HelioIQ color palette (primary: #3A7FFF, bg: #101214)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using a simple "H" monogram or weight scale icon
- Ensure good contrast for both light and dark backgrounds
- Test how it looks when installed on home screen

## Temporary Placeholder

Until custom icons are created, you can use a simple colored square as a placeholder. The manifest.json is already configured to use these icon sizes.
